## Notes

### Svelte

> Source: [Svelte course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/svelte/) by Rich Harris and Frontend Masters.

- Svelte is a component framework.
- Svelte is a compiler that takes declarative code and turns it into imperative JS.
- HTML is the base language rather than JavaScript.
